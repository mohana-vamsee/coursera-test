                <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    An operating system is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware. Every computer must have at least one OS to run other programs. An application like Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc needs some environment in which it will run and perform its task.
                    The OS helps you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. It is not possible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an operating system.

                <h2>Network Security</h2>
                <p>Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats.Effective network security manages access to the network. It targets a variety of threats and stops them from entering or spreading on your network.
